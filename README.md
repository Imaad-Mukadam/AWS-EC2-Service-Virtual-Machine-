# AWS-EC2-Service-Virtual-Machine

## Summary

### **AWS EC2 Web Server Setup**  

This project automates the deployment of an EC2 instance and configures it as a web server. A script is provided in the **"User Data"** section to install and start a web server, serving a simple `index.html` page.  

#### **Steps:**  
âœ… **Launch EC2 Instance** â€“ Create an EC2 instance with a preferred OS (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, etc.).  
âœ… **Attach a Startup Script** â€“ Use the **User Data** section to run a shell script on instance launch.  
âœ… **Install Web Server** â€“ The script installs and starts Apache/Nginx.  
âœ… **Deploy Web Page** â€“ An `index.html` file is created and served on the instanceâ€™s public IP.  

#### **User Data Script (Example for Apache on Amazon Linux 2):**  
```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Welcome to My EC2 Web Server!</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

This setup ensures the web server is installed and running as soon as the EC2 instance is created. ðŸš€
